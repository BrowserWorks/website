## Introduction

In 2023, Waterfox underwent significant changes. This pivotal year brought a refreshed website, regained independence, and several important releases.

## Independence

Waterfox has regained its independence, re-emphasising something that I hold import to this project â€” putting users first. This shift allows the company to iterate a bit faster and focus more on user privacy and customisation.

## Website Revamp

The Waterfox website got a complete makeover, offering a more intuitive experience. With a fresh design and improved functionality, the goal is to make the website a bit more informative for new users.

## Notable Releases

### Android App Launch

Waterfox expanded its reach with the launch of the Android app. This addition lets users enjoy the same privacy-focused browsing on their mobile devices.

### DNS over Oblivious HTTP

In collaboration with Fastly, Waterfox introduced DNS over Oblivious HTTP, ensuring user privacy and a secure browsing experience.

## Ongoing Developments

### Vertical Tabs on the Horizon

Vertical Tabs are in full-time technical planning. Expected for testing between Q1 and Q2, Waterfox is excited to announce a new partnership, promising a solid improvement on most other experiences out there.

### Android Upgrade, WebExtensions Support, and Darker Dark Theme

Waterfox is actively upgrading its Android app and ensuring support for all WebExtensions. This includes moving to a monthly rolling release, keeping up with the latest Android Components versions, instead of sticking with ESR. Additionally, a sleeker, darker theme is in the works for those who prefer a darker tones in the UI.

### Private Search

A privacy-focused search project, teased earlier, is nearly ready for a closed beta. Stay tuned for announcements!

## Future Endeavours

Looking ahead, Waterfox is set for growth and improving the browsing experience. Plans include improving user privacy, introducing a few new features, and expanding community initiatives. 

The year 2023 was a milestone-packed journey for Waterfox! As we move forward, I extend my heartfelt thanks to the community for your support. Here's to a great 2024!
