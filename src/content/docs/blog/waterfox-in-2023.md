## Introduction

In 2023, Waterfox embarked on a transformative journey. This pivotal year saw a resurgence of advancements, including a refreshed website, independence, and significant releases.

## Independence Restored

Waterfox celebrated a pivotal moment by reclaiming its independence, aligning its values with a renewed dedication to user-centric browsing. This move allowed the company to chart its own path, prioritising privacy, security, and user empowerment.

## Website Revamp

The Waterfox website underwent a comprehensive transformation, offering a fresh and intuitive interface to visitors. The updated design, coupled with improved functionality, aims to provide a seamless browsing experience and accessible information for both existing users and potential newcomers.

## Notable Releases

### Android App Launch

Waterfox expanded its horizons by introducing the long-awaited Android app. This new addition to the Waterfox ecosystem empowers users to enjoy the same privacy-focused browsing experience seamlessly on their mobile devices.

### DNS over Oblivious HTTP

In a groundbreaking partnership with Fastly, Waterfox rolled out the DNS over Oblivious HTTP, a cutting-edge privacy feature. This advancement underscores Waterfox's commitment to user privacy, ensuring a secure and private browsing experience.

## Ongoing Developments

### Vertical Tabs on the Horizon

While slightly behind schedule, the implementation of Vertical Tabs has transitioned into full-time technical planning. Anticipated for testing from the end of Q1 to the start of Q2, Waterfox is thrilled to announce an upcoming partnership surrounding this feature, promising an innovative browsing experience to users.

### Android Upgrade, WebExtensions Support and Darker Dark Theme

Waterfox is actively engaged in upgrading its Android app to incorporate the latest Android Components. Simultaneously, efforts are underway to ensure comprehensive support for all WebExtensions, amplifying the browser's compatibility and functionality.

A darker, more immersive dark theme is on its way to Waterfox for Android, catering to users who prefer a sleeker, more refined browsing aesthetic.

### Private Search

The privacy focused search project teased in the release notes is near ready and will be available as a closed beta soon. Keep your eyes peeled for an announcement post.

## Future Endeavours

Looking ahead, Waterfox is poised for continued growth and innovation. Plans are in place to further enhance user privacy, introduce innovative features, and expand its community-driven initiatives. Challenges are seen as opportunities for progress, fostering an environment of continual improvement.

The year 2023 was a milestone-filled chapter for Waterfox. As it strides forward, I'd like to extend my gratitude to the community.
