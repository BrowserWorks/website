### New Features
* You can now move and remove the extension button from the navigation bar.
    * Access this via Menu > More tools > Customize toolbar...

### Bug fixes
* You should now, once again, be able to install extensions from the Chrome Web Store.

### Changes
* Lepton has been updated to 8.0.0.
* Small theme tweaks to align close to previous generations of Waterfox.

### Upcoming Changes
* Waterfox for Android's feature set has been finalised, but requires updating to the latest components. This is in progress and is due for release. iOS is now in the pipeline as well.
* Privacy enhancements to some of the most popular search engines (wink wink, nudge nudge) are also in the pipeline, with more to be revealed soon.
