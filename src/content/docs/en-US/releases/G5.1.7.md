ℹ️ Changed

* Waterfox on Windows now FULLY supports DRM. That means streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO Max and more will work!

❓ Known Issues

* macOS does not currently support DRM protected streaming services, but this will be fixed in a subsequent release. (Linxu TBD).
* Certain customisation in Look & Feel do not work.
* Upgrading to G5 resets custom container tabs in certain situations. We have investigated but have been unable to find a work around or fix so far.
* If you cannot select text in the search bar with the mouse cursor please go to `about:config`, set `layout.forms.input-type-search.enabled` to `false` and restart the browser.
