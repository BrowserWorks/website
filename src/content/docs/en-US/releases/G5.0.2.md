Waterfox's custom look and feel now applies to all themes by default. You can turn this off by typing `about:config` in the address bar, search for `userChrome.theme.enable` and toggle it to `false`.

✔ Fixed

* The option to "Open All Bookmarks" once again works.
* DNS-over-HTTPS being forced on users will no longer happen by default.
* Forms will no longer save data in Private Tab.
* Disabling images now works properly.

ℹ️ Changed

* Various security fixes <sup>[1](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2022-45/)</sup>.


❓ Known Issues

* Upgrading to G5 resets custom container tabs in certain situations. We have investigated but have been unable to find a work around or fix so far.
* For native messaging issues, please try to symlink the NativeMessagingHosts directory from Mozilla to Waterfox:<br/>
`ln -s ~/Library/Application\ Support/Mozilla/NativeMessagingHosts ~/Library/Application\ Support/Waterfox/NativeMessagingHosts`<br/>
A permanent fix will be coming in the next release so that this will no longer be required.
* If you cannot select text in the search bar with the mouse cursor please go to `about:config`, set `layout.forms.input-type-search.enabled` to `false` and restart the browser.
