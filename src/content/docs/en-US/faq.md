### 1. What is Waterfox?

Waterfox is a web browser, used to surf the web. You are using a web browser right now, reading this! It's the portal to the world wide web and arguably your most important piece of software installed. Waterfox has two versions: Classic and Current. Classic is for legacy systems and is there for only those who have specific need for it. Current is the up to date version which works best with websites and is for much newer systems.

### 2. Why use Waterfox?

Waterfox is built to be privacy conscious and fast. We allow you to make the choices within your browser, while providing sane defaults to make sure things run smoothly for the average user. You may expect that to be the same for every browser, but each of them have different goals - ours is to make sure you don't have to be worrying about what's happening within your browser.

### 3. How is personal data handled?

### 4. What technology is Waterfox built on?

Waterfox is powered by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Gecko">Gecko</a>. Most web browsers are powered by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Blink">Blink</a> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/WebKit">WebKit</a>, but we've chosen to use the technology that better supports our goals.
