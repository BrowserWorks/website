✨ New

* Added a toggle on `about:preferences` to force light/dark mode with Lepton theme.

✓ Fixed

* Private tab will now correctly not store search suggestions and recently closed tabs.
* Private tab icon will now only appear in Lepton theme, so should no longer appear on themes that do not have context menu icons.
* Forcing dark mode in Lepton with `ui.systemUsesDarkTheme` on Linux distros should now work.

❌ Unresolved

* Addon version numbers are not displayed next to their title in `about:addons`.
* Auto updates can still not be completely stopped. PR is ready but we are just doing additional checks to ensure nothing breaks.
