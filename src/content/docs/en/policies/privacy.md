###### Version 1.1 — 11 October 2021

## An easy to digest privacy policy

We strive to collect only the absolute minimum to provide you with a useable web experience. We try to avoid any personal data where we can and keep data collection to the minimum.

In this Privacy Notice, we explain what data Waterfox shares and point you to settings to share even less.

## Waterfox by default shares data to:

Waterfox does not collect telemetry about your installation - any telemetry modules are disable when the browser is built. What you do in your browser is only known by you.

### Search

You can perform searches directly from several places in Waterfox, including the Awesome Bar, Search Bar, or on a New Tab. We receive data about the number of searches you request from our search partners.

- **Location data**: When you first use Waterfox, it uses your IP address to set your default search provider based on your country. [Learn more](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/change-your-default-search-settings-firefox).
- **Search queries**: Waterfox by default sends search queries to your search provider to help you discover common phrases other people have searched for and improve your search experience if your selected search provider supports search suggestions. [Learn more](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/use-popular-search-suggestions-firefox-search-bar), including how to disable this feature.

### Improve security for users everywhere

**Technical data for updates**: Desktop versions of Watrfox check for browser updates by persistently connecting to Waterfox's update servers. Your Waterfox version, language, specific search configurations and device operating system are used to apply the correct updates. Mobile versions of Firefox may connect to another service if you used one to download and install Firefox. [Learn more](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/how-stop-firefox-automatically-making-connections#w_auto-update-checking).

Note: The above cannot be changed as without this information we cannot provide you with the correct update files.

**Technical data for add-ons blocklist**: Waterfox for Desktop and Android periodically connect to external services to protect you and others from malicious add-ons. Your Watrfox version and language, device operating system, and list of installed add-ons are needed to apply and update the add-ons blocklist. [Learn more](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/how-stop-firefox-making-automatic-connections).

**Webpage and technical data to Certificate Authorities**: When you visit a secure website (usually identified with a URL starting with "HTTPS"), Waterfox validates the website's [certificate](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/secure-website-certificate). This may involve Waterfox sending certain information about the website to the Certificate Authority identified by that website. Opting out increases the risk of your private information being intercepted. [Learn more](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/advanced-settings-browsing-network-updates-encryption#w_certificates-tab).
