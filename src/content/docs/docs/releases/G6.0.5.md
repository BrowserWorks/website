### Changes

- Security fixes[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2023-46/).

### Fixes

- Modal dialogues that display checkboxes would erroneously have two checkboxes, even if they weren't meant to. This has now been fixed.

### Upcoming Changes

- Waterfox for Android's feature set has been finalised, but requires updating to the latest components. This is in progress and is due for release. iOS is now in the pipeline as well.
- Privacy enhancements to some of the most popular search engines (wink wink, nudge nudge) are also in the pipeline, with more to be revealed soon.
