### Fixed Issues

- Setting Waterfox as the default browser on Windows does not work.
- "Autohide" behaviour of the Waterfox vertical tabs does not work for F11 fullscreen mode.
- An error is reported when the vertical tabs options page is opened.
- "Bookmark Selected Tabs" command in the menu of the sidebar header does not work.
- Items in the menu of the vertical tabs header are shown with the same "gear" icon - this is due to missing Waterfox specific icon resources.
- Tab preview on vertical tabs does not work with browser.tabs.hoverPreview.enabled=true.
- F1 key does not toggle the Waterfox vertical tabs.
- "Reset to default" operation in the toolbar customisation sometimes produces missing "Waterfox vertical tabs" button problem.
