### Changes

- Status bar text is now vertically aligned, instead of being completely misaligned. Thanks to [@black7375](https://github.com/black7375)
- Updates to the tabs sidebar (1.0.2).
    - Improved tab organization: Users can now pin tabs and navigate between them using keyboard shortcuts. This makes it easier to keep track of multiple open tabs and switch between them quickly.
    - Enhanced scrolling: The sidebar now supports smooth scrolling, which provides a more fluid and responsive user experience.
    - Improved communication: Changes have improved communication between the sidebar and the background script. This should result in a more stable and reliable user experience.
    - Performance improvements: Changes should result in better performance when updating the size and position of tabs in the sidebar.
- Security fixes[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2024-26/).
