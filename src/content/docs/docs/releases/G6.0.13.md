    - Fixed various visual issues.
    - The sidebar no longer erroneously appears as an extension.

### Upcoming Changes

- [Sign up](https://browserworks.typeform.com/to/E1KEJaKj) to get access to Waterfox Privacy Search. We are currently testing in a closed Alpha, which will then be opened to general access in a Beta.
