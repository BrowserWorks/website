✨ New

- Added a toggle on `about:preferences` to force light/dark mode with Lepton theme.

✓ Fixed

- Private tab will now correctly not store search suggestions and recently closed tabs.
- Private tab icon will now only appear in Lepton theme, so should no longer appear on themes that do not have context menu icons.
- Forcing dark mode in Lepton with `ui.systemUsesDarkTheme` on Linux distros should now work.

❌ Unresolved

- Addon version numbers are not displayed next to their title in `about:addons`.
- Auto updates can still not be completely stopped. PR is ready but we are just doing additional checks to ensure nothing breaks.
