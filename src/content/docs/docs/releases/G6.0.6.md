### Updates

- DNS over Oblivious HTTP is now powered by Fastly! [Read more](blog/waterfox-in-partnership-with-fastly).
  - This should mean you should experience almost no performance penalty for using DoOH.

### Changes

- You can now choose to disable closing windows or tabs with Ctrl+W by setting `browser.closeShortcut.disabled` to `true` in `about:config`.
- Improved support for JPEG XL. Waterfox can now act as the default image viewer for such image files.
- Waterfox will now run with hardware acceleration on VMware hosts.
- Security fixes[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2023-50/).

### Fixes

- Waterfox company information and versioning should now show BrowserWorks Ltd and the display version properly in Control Panel. A re-install with the latest installer is required.
- Waterfox should now startup slightly faster, due to it previously not trusting signed binaries.

### Upcoming Changes

- Privacy enhancements to some of the most popular search engines (wink wink, nudge nudge) are also in the pipeline, with more to be revealed soon.
