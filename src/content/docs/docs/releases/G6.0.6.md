### Changes

- You can now choose to disable closing windows or tabs with Ctrl+W by setting `browser.closeShortcut.disabled` to `true` in `about:config`. [@franklx](https://github.com/WaterfoxCo/Waterfox/pull/3255)
- Improved support for JPEG XL. Waterfox can now act as the default image viewer for such image files. [@goodusername123](https://github.com/WaterfoxCo/Waterfox/pull/3262)
- Waterfox will now run with hardware acceleration on VMware hosts. [@goodusername123](https://github.com/WaterfoxCo/Waterfox/pull/3261)

### Fixes

### Upcoming Changes
