### New Features

- Native support for the Unity menu bar on Linux.

### Bug fixes

- Issues attmepting to login to some websites have now been resolved.
- Some popular websites (looking at you EA) are using weak encryption methods, so we've had to loosen the screws a bit to allow connections to them.

### Changes

- A new logo has proven popular in general. There are some issues with it, which need fixing. While this occurs, builds will switch back to the old logo.

### Upcoming Changes

- Waterfox for Android's feature set has been finalised, but requires updating to the latest components. This is in progress and is due for release. iOS is now in the pipeline as well.
- Privacy enhancements to some of the most popular search engines (wink wink, nudge nudge) are also in the pipeline, with more to be revealed soon.
