### Changes

- The Waterfox sidebar is now available by default. There have been many bug fixes an improvements since the previous release, thanks to everyone who reported them! Side note: There is a small bug where in tab preview mode, there may be empty space above/below the tab previews. Opening a new tab should solve the issue.
- You now have the option to hide the "close" button on tabs, using the preferences `browser.tabs.closeButtons`.
- Security fixes[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2024-19/).

### Upcoming Changes
