:::info

Waterfox's custom look and feel now applies to all themes by default. You can disable or modify this by going to the Preferences page → Look & Feel.

✔ Fixed

- Issue playing Netflix and similar DRM protected websites have now resolved. If it's not working straight away, you can update the DRM plugin by going to the Preferences page → General → Files and Applications and un-check "Play DRM-controlled content". Wait for a few seconds, then re-check the box. The DRM plugin should update.
- Drag space is now disabled by default (that extra space above your tabs, so you can drag the window around).
- The status bar colour now matches the navigation bar.

ℹ️ Changed

- Various security fixes <sup>[1](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2022-52/)</sup>.

❓ Known Issues

- Upgrading to G5 resets custom container tabs in certain situations. We have investigated but have been unable to find a work around or fix so far.
- If you cannot select text in the search bar with the mouse cursor please go to `about:config`, set `layout.forms.input-type-search.enabled` to `false` and restart the browser.
