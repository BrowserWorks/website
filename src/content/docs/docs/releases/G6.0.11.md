### Changes

- Security fixes[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2024-16/).
- You can now start testing the Waterfox Sidebar. Go to `about:config`, search for `browser.sidebar.disabled` and set the value to `false`. Please submit any feedback to the [Issues](https://github.com/BrowserWorks/Waterfox/issues) page.
- Some bug fixes.

Unless any major issues crop up, the next release of Waterfox will include the sidebar by default. Please note we won't stop working on it until then! Improvements are continuous, almost daily.
