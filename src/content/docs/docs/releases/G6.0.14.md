### Changes

- The minimum CPU requirement has now been loosened. Any x86-64 processors with support for [SSE3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE3#CPUs_with_SSE3) should now be able to run Waterfox[^1].
- Various UI bug fixes.
- Updates to the tabs sidebar.
    - Keep sidebar showing after leaving fullscreen mode.
    - Respect user's choice for `browser.tabs.insertAfterCurrent` and `browser.tabs.insertRelatedAfterCurrent`.
- Security fixes[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2024-22/).

### Upcoming Changes

- [Sign up](https://browserworks.typeform.com/to/E1KEJaKj) to get access to Waterfox Privacy Search. We are currently testing in a closed Alpha, which will then be opened to general access in a Beta. Note: As it currently stands, this is a separate and optional product that will not be included in Waterfox.
