label: Enhanced Tracking Protection in Waterfox for Android

Waterfox for Android uses a list provided by Disconnect to identify and block known trackers on the websites you visit. Tap the lock icon !Fx89Padlock that appears in the address bar to check if Waterfox is actively blocking trackers on that page. Read Disconnect documentation about tracking and standards they use to create their list or the Mozilla Wiki about the lists used by Waterfox for _Enhanced Tracking Protection_.

_Enhanced Tracking Protection_ is enabled by default. Tap the lock icon that appears in the address bar to open the protections panel. The toggle next to _Enhanced Tracking Protection_ changes to purple when on to indicate that trackers are being actively blocked for that site.

Enhanced Tracking Protection is on by default, but you can turn it off or change your level of protection:

1.  Tap the menu button.
2.  Tap `Settings`.
3.  Under _Privacy and Security_, tap `Enhanced Tracking Protection`.
4.  Tap the switch to turn it on or off.
5.  If turning it on, choose the level of protection you want.
    *   **Standard:** Protects you from social media trackers, cross-site trackers and cryptominers.
    *   **Strict:** Blocks tracking content (videos, ads and other content that contain tracking code) in addition to trackers blocked in the Standard setting. The _Strict_ setting might block some website functionality.
    *   **Custom:** Blocks tracking content (videos, ads and other content that contain tracking code) but you can choose which trackers and scripts to block (cookies, tracking content, cryptominers and fingerprinters).

1.  Tap the lock icon in the address bar to view if _Enhanced Tracking Protection_ is on for a site.
2.  Tap under _Enhanced Tracking Protection_ and then tap each category of trackers to see exactly what’s being blocked.

_Total Cookie Protection_ is a feature built into _Enhanced Tracking Protection_ that isolates tracking cookies to the site that created them to prevent cookies from tracking your activity across websites. Waterfox makes an exception for non-tracking cookies, so websites continue to work.

Some websites rely on cookies to work correctly. _Total Cookie protection_ may block required cookies for a website and cause it to seem broken. To check if it’s a Total Cookie Protection-related issue:

1.  Try turning off _Enhanced Tracking Protection_ for that website following the steps below. Turning off protections will automatically disable _Total Cookie Protection_ for that website.
2.  Refresh the website.

If the page loads correctly, it is a _Total Cookie Protection_\-related issue.

**Note:** Turning _Enhanced Tracking Protection_ off for a specific website will add that website to your _Exceptions_ list. If you wish to turn it back on for that site, tap the **Enhanced Tracking Protection** toggle again or remove the website from your Exceptions list.

1.  Tap the lock icon !Fx89Padlock in the address bar while you're on the website that you want to manage.
2.  Tap the **Enhanced Tracking Protection** toggle to turn it on or off for that site.

1.  Tap the menu button. !Settings icon in address bar in android
    
2.  Tap `Settings`.
3.  Tap `Enhanced Tracking Protection` in the _Privacy and Security_ section.
