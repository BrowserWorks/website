    "body": "The first Beta release of G6! With the never-ending focus on improving privacy and performance, this release is be a tasty one. \r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n* Waterfox now uses Oblivious DNS[^1] by default, a privacy preserving method for DNS queries.\r\n\r\n### Performance Improvements\r\n* Waterfox is now compiled with PGO[^2] on Windows and macOS.\r\n* Waterfox is now compiled with a polyhedral optimiser[^3].\r\n\r\n### Misc.\r\n* Some bugs may be carried over from G5, please report them!\r\n* Themes have been updated, which should fix various bugs.\r\n* Waterfox is now based on ESR115.\r\n\r\n### Upcoming Changes\r\n* Waterfox's logo will potentially be updated in an upcoming beta release, so keep an eye out.\r\n* Alongside an update to the logo, the website is also getting a fresh lick of paint.\r\n* Some more performance oriented upgrades are in testing, but may not make it for final release.\r\n* Waterfox for Android's feature set has been finalised, but requires updating to the latest components. This is in progress and is due for release. iOS is now in the pipeline as well.\r\n* Privacy enhancements to some of the most popular search engines (wink wink, nudge nudge) are also in the pipeline, with more to be revealed soon. \r\n* Linux deserves some love too, and optimisations are in the works for the final release.\r\n* A complete revamp of the config options set by default is also on it's way.\r\n\r\nApologies for the delay on this release, setting up the privacy relay for ODNS as well as creating the toolchain for polly support took longer than anticipated. Waterfox's independence also contributed to the delay of this release, but it is a delay worth celebrating 🥳\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://cdn1.waterfox.net/waterfox/releases/G6.0b1/Linux_x86_64/waterfox-G6.0b1.tar.bz2\"><img src=\"https://github.com/WaterfoxCo/Waterfox/assets/4728920/ed2d5869-94ad-43e9-a8b0-51da0937b8e4\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" /> Download for Linux</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://cdn1.waterfox.net/waterfox/releases/G6.0b1/Darwin_x86_64-aarch64/Waterfox%20G6.0b1.dmg\"><img src=\"https://github.com/WaterfoxCo/Waterfox/assets/4728920/ed2d5869-94ad-43e9-a8b0-51da0937b8e4\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" /> Download for macOS</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://cdn1.waterfox.net/waterfox/releases/G6.0b1/WINNT_x86_64/Waterfox%20Setup%20G6.0b1.exe\"><img src=\"https://github.com/WaterfoxCo/Waterfox/assets/4728920/ed2d5869-94ad-43e9-a8b0-51da0937b8e4\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" /> Download for Windows</a>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[^1]: With regular DNS, your DNS queries are sent in plain text, allowing your internet provider to easily see every website you request.\r\n\r\n    DNS over HTTPS encrypts your DNS queries with HTTPS, so your internet provider cannot read the contents. However, they can still see that you are making requests to a DNS server, and potentially correlate timing information to identify sites.\r\n\r\n    Oblivious DNS goes further by routing encrypted queries through proxy servers in a way that obscures the true intended domain. Your internet provider cannot associate queries with specific sites you visit.\r\n\r\n    So both Oblivious DNS and DNS over HTTPS prevent spying on the specific domains you lookup. But Oblivious DNS better hides the fact that you are making any query for a given site at all. It adds an extra layer of indirection and privacy protection.\r\n\r\n    The main advantage of Oblivious DNS over DNS over HTTPS is that it better prevents network-level tracking of your web browsing habits by your ISP or others running the network infrastructure. It hides the act of looking up a site in the first place.\r\n\r\n[^2]: When you use a web browser, it has to perform a lot of repetitive tasks - like rendering web pages, running JavaScript code, and parsing CSS. These tasks follow certain patterns each time you use the browser.\r\n\r\n    PGO allows the compiler to detect these patterns and optimize the browser code. \r\n\r\n    The result is a web browser optimized for real-world use, not just theoretical usage. Web pages will render faster, scripts will run faster, and the browser will feel much more snappy and responsive.\r\n    \r\n[^3]: As previously mentioned, when you use a web browser, it has to repeat similar tasks over and over - like rendering webpage elements, running JavaScript code, scrolling the page, and displaying videos.\r\n\r\n    These tasks involve loops, where the browser does the same kind of work over and over. Polyhedral optimisation makes the browser's loops run faster by reorganizing them. It finds the best way to access data repeatedly in the most efficient order.\r\n\r\n    For example, when scrolling a page with lots of images, polyhedral optimisation could optimise the loops that decode and display the image data. It finds the fastest way to reuse image data in the CPU cache.\r\n\r\n    This means scrolling feels much smoother. The images decode quicker as you scroll up and down. The browser feels snappier.\r\n\r\n    So in simple terms, polyhedral optimisation tunes the browser's inner loops to make maximum use of the CPU and memory. This speeds up repetitive tasks like rendering, scrolling, and video playback that rely on loops. The end result is a faster, smoother browsing experience for the user.",

    "body": "Welcome to the 5th generation of Waterfox.\r\n\r\nAutomatic updates will slowly start over the next week.\r\n\r\n✨ New\r\n\r\n* You can now toggle to view password you are typing in.\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4728920/191992639-ed17cfbb-f096-418f-a324-056f36d7c62c.png\" width=\"233px\" />\r\n\r\nℹ️ Changed\r\n\r\n* Due to better understanding of compiler flags, the minimum supported processor version has dropped and is now set at SSSE3[1].\r\n* More speed! Waterfox now has further speed improvements on all platforms, with the largest increase on Linux.\r\n* You can now Sync your settings.\r\n* The `search` [input type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/search) is now enabled.\r\n\r\n⚠️ Notices\r\n\r\n* If you use custom CSS and JS, you will want to disable Waterfox theme changes by toggling `userChrome.theme.enable` to `false`.\r\n\r\n## Platform changes from G4 → G5\r\n\r\n### Media Changes\r\n* Full-range color levels are now supported for video playback on many systems.\r\n* Mac users can now access the macOS share options from the Waterfox File menu.\r\n* Support for images containing ICC v4 profiles is enabled on macOS.\r\n* Waterfox now supports the new AVIF image format, which is based on the modern and royalty-free AV1 video codec. It offers significant bandwidth savings for sites compared to existing image formats. It also supports transparency and other advanced features.\r\n* Waterfox PDF viewer now supports filling more forms (e.g., XFA-based forms, used by multiple governments and banks).\r\n* When available system memory is critically low, Waterfox on Windows will automatically unload tabs based on their last access time, memory usage, and other attributes. This helps to reduce Waterfox out-of-memory crashes. Forgot something? Switching to an unloaded tab automatically reloads it.\r\n* To prevent session loss for macOS users who are running Waterfox from a mounted .dmg file, they’ll now be prompted to finish installation. Bear in mind, this permission prompt only appears the first time these users run Waterfox on their computer.\r\n* Gecko introduces significant improvements in noise suppression and auto-gain-control, as well as slight improvements in echo-cancellation to provide you with a better overall experience.\r\n* You can now toggle Narrate in ReaderMode with the keyboard shortcut \"n.\"\r\n* You can now move the Picture-in-Picture toggle button to the opposite side of the video. Simply look for the new context menu option Move Picture-in-Picture Toggle to Left (Right) Side.\r\n* Captions/subtitles display on YouTube, Prime Video, and Netflix videos you watch in Picture-in-Picture. Just turn on the subtitles on the in-page video player, and they will appear in PiP.\r\n* Picture-in-Picture now also supports video captions on websites that use Web Video Text Track (WebVTT) format (e.g., Coursera.org, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and many more).\r\n* HDR video is now supported in Waterfox on Mac—starting with YouTube! Waterfox users on macOS 11+ (with HDR-compatible screens) can enjoy higher-fidelity video content. No need to manually flip any preferences to turn HDR video support on—just make sure battery preferences are NOT set to “optimize video streaming while on battery”.\r\n* Hardware-accelerated AV1 video decoding is enabled on Windows with supported GPUs (Intel Gen 11+, AMD RDNA 2 Excluding Navi 24, GeForce 30). Installing the AV1 Video Extension from the Microsoft Store may also be required.\r\n* Reading is now easier with the prefers-contrast media query, which allows sites to detect if the user has requested that web content is presented with a higher (or lower) contrast.\r\n\r\n### Security Changes\r\n* Waterfox can now automatically upgrade to HTTPS using HTTPS RR as Alt-Svc headers.\r\n* Improved web compatibility for privacy protections with SmartBlock 3.0: In Private Browsing and Strict Tracking Protection, Waterfox goes to great lengths to protect your web browsing activity from trackers. As part of this, the built-in content blocking will automatically block third-party scripts, images, and other content from being loaded from cross-site tracking companies reported by Disconnect.\r\n* Introducing a new referrer tracking protection in Strict Tracking Protection and Private Browsing. This feature prevents sites from unknowingly leaking private information to trackers.\r\n* RLBox—a new technology that hardens Waterfox against potential security vulnerabilities in third-party libraries—is now enabled on all platforms.\r\n* The Linux sandbox has been strengthened: processes exposed to web content no longer have access to the X Window system (X11).\r\n* Waterfox now ignores less restricted referrer policies—including unsafe-url, no-referrer-when-downgrade, and origin-when-cross-origin—for cross-site subresource/iframe requests to prevent privacy leaks from the referrer.\r\n\r\n### Operating System Specific Changes\r\n\r\n* Waterfox for macOS now uses Apple's low-power mode for fullscreen video on sites such as YouTube and Twitch. This meaningfully extends battery life in long viewing sessions.\r\n* Power users can use about:unloads to release system resources by manually unloading tabs without closing them.\r\n* On Linux, improved WebGL performance and reduced power consumption for many users.\r\n* To better protect all Waterfox users against side-channel attacks, such as Spectre, Gecko introduced Site Isolation.\r\n* Waterfox supports the new Snap Layouts menus when running on Windows 11.\r\n* Reduced CPU usage on macOS in Waterfox and WindowServer during event processing.\r\n* Reduced the power usage of software decoded video on macOS, especially in fullscreen. This includes streaming sites such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.\r\n* Waterfox now supports and displays the new style of scrollbars on Windows 11.\r\n* Video overlay is enabled on Windows for Intel GPUs, reducing power usage during video playback.\r\n* Scrollbars on Linux and Windows 11 won't take space by default. On Linux, users can change this in Settings. On Windows, Waterfox follows the system setting (System Settings > Accessibility > Visual Effects > Always show scrollbars).\r\n* Waterfox now allows users to use as many microphones as they want, at the same time, during video conferencing. The most exciting benefit is that you can easily switch your microphones at any time (if your conferencing service provider enables this flexibility).\r\n\r\nPlease find additional developer changes in the [Gecko 102](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/102) notes.",
